# Js-Midi-Piano

Create a Piano with JavaScript, just like <https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/JavaScript-Piano>, but without sound files.

Of course, no external libraries, only HTML5 Audio API.

I might try to create with a library, like [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/), later -- for a more natural sounding.

## Plan

Make the sound more natural, preferrably, without a library.
